Leverages RaptorX's great scintilla wrapper for Auto Hot Key https://github.com/RaptorX/scintilla-wrapper

This version of scratchpad utilizes the Scintilla text control and allows searching. The original utility utilized a plain text field without line numbers which I found made it difficult to jump to different portions of the text. The utility is designed as a temporary scratch space to put bits of code you are currently working with and not as a permanent storage space. I find it useful to save the editor content in a dropbox controlled directory so I can have access to my little text bits across systems.

The releases here are for windows 64bit but the ahk script could be modified to call a 32 bit scilexer dll if need be.
